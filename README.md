# catty music app

https://itskoyii.github.io/catty-music/

This is originally a CSS tutorial by Ohans Emmanuel's Catty Music App Layout with CSS Grid. 

I created my own version in Webflow with enhanced stylings and added animations. This is my first Webflow project and I'm pretty proud of it! ðŸ˜„

You can save each song by clicking on the â™¡ and unsave by clicking it again. By clicking "Play all", a playlist will pop up from the bottom of the page. In the future, I would like to change the music info in the bottom pop up playlist as the user click on a specific song.


Thanks for visiting!
